This is the repository for my resume.

The class here is a customized (and minor) version of [Martin Varela](https://github.com/mvarela)'s work at https://github.com/mvarela/orbit-cv.

If you want the real thing, I strongly suggest checking that repo. 

If you still like and want to use my cut down version, you can do that by all means.
